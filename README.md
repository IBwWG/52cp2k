This game pays homage to (my probably rusty memory of) a parody found in the infamous studio chatter of one of the You Don't Know Jack series.  I am not affiliated with the makers of that game in any way.

The instructions are found on-screen.

You can, if you want, say aloud things like this while playing:

- "Whoa!  There are cards all *over* the place!"
- "There's a five of hearts underneath this table!  I'm gonna pick it up."
- "There's a jack of clubs on the sofa!  I'm gonna pick it up."

Made with Godot 2.1.1, which I downloaded yesterday morning.  I had never tried Godot before.  It's not perfect (let me know if you find something that is!) but there are a lot of things that are quite easy to accomplish with it, e.g. sound.

As a base, I started with the demo at https://github.com/khairul169/godot-cabinet/tree/master/templates/fps-camera .

I also used Bfxr, Audacity, and ImageMagick.

The following assets I found on the internet during the compo.  They each have a licence that, as I understand it, can be used in a non-commercial game:

- Music: www.bensound.com
- Sofa: Yurii Burdukh
- Table: Gela Motskobili
- Floor: opengameart.org
- Wallpaper: public domain
